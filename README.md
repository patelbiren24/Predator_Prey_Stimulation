# Predator_Prey_Stimulation

This application stimulates a population growth model between two insects. The two species are doodlebugs and ants. This idea was adapted from a textbook Absolute Java by Walter Savage. This application can be best described as a predatory/prey scenario, and a lot of variation and stimulations models exists out there.
